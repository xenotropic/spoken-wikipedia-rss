# spoken-wikipedia-rss
Makes an RSS podcast feed out of the Spoken Wikipedia project files. The generatepod.py creates (to stdout) an RSS feed of the Spoken Wikimedia Project files. It uses the native ogg files from Wikipedia, so you'd only expect it to work on platforms that support it, like Android. I've tested it only with Antennapod. 
A copy of the generated feed is at https://morris.cloud/spokenwikipedia/  
To open the Spoken Wikimedia Project in AntennaPod, tap the three-line menu in the top left, "Add Podcast", look down under "Advanced" and tap on "Add Podcast by RSS address".
