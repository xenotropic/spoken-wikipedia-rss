# Makes A Podcast Feed From The Spoken Wikipedia Project 
This repo has a python script that generates an RSS podcast feed out of the Spoken Wikipedia project files, using [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Spoken_articles) as the data source. The generatepod.py script creates (to stdout) an RSS feed of the Spoken Wikimedia Project files. It uses the native ogg files from Wikipedia, so you'd only expect it to work on platforms that support it, like Android. I've tested it only with Antennapod. 
A copy of the generated feed is at https://morris.cloud/spokenwikipedia/  
To open the Spoken Wikimedia Project in AntennaPod, tap the three-line menu in the top left, "Add Podcast", look down under "Advanced" and tap on "Add Podcast by RSS address". It's a big podcast -- 1600+ "episodes" as of Feb 2023 -- so it will take a few seconds to open up. Click "subscribe" and you should be on your way. 
My next plan is to add to the script, or make another one, to download and convert the files to mp3, which be a more "normal" podcast that would work for most users and could be submitted to podcast feed listings.
